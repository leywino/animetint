# AnimeTint

AnimeTint is a small Android utility that replicates the immersive "Reading Mode" effect found on some tablets—specifically the Xiaomi Pad 6. This mode adds a subtle warm tint and grainy noise overlay to the screen, creating a cinematic feel that's perfect for watching anime or reading manga.

I created AnimeTint because I loved this experience on my tablet and wanted to enjoy the same visual vibe on my phone too.
