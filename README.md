# AnimeTint

AnimeTint is a small Android utility that replicates the immersive "Reading Mode" effect found on some tablets—specifically the Xiaomi Pad 6. This mode adds a subtle warm tint and grainy noise overlay to the screen, creating a cinematic feel that's perfect for watching anime or reading manga.

I created AnimeTint because I loved this experience on my tablet and wanted to enjoy the same visual vibe on my phone too.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 Tint Color – Choose from multiple preset tint colors.
- 🌗 Tint Intensity – Control how warm or subtle the overlay looks.
- 🎞️ Noise Intensity – Add adjustable screen noise for a film-like aesthetic.
- 🧱 Material UI – Clean and familiar Material 3 design.
